.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl B
Run the client in background mode.
.It Fl F

As new devices appear, they are automatically made visible to other ALSA MIDI clients.
.It Fl d
Specify the device name of the USB device to use, for example /dev/umidi0.0 .
This option can be repeated to specify more devices.
.It Fl C
Specify the capture only device name of the USB device to use, for example /dev/umidi0.0 .
This option can be repeated to specify more capture devices.
.It Fl P
Specify the playback only device name of the USB device to use, for example /dev/umidi0.0 .
This option can be repeated to specify more playback only devices.
.It Fl s
Specify character device name for ALSA sequencer.
The default is snd/seq.
.It Fl U
Specify username for the ALSA character device.
The default is root.
.It Fl G
Specify groupname for the ALSA character device.
The default is wheel.
